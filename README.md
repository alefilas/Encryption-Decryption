Encryption-Decryption
=====================
This project uses the strategy pattern. The program works with command line arguments.  

* -mode : should determine the programâ€™s mode (enc for encryption, dec for decryption);
* -key : an integer key to modify the message;
* -data : text or ciphertext to encrypt or decrypt;
* -in : the full name of a file to read data;
* -out : the full name of a file to write the result;
* -alg : choice of algorithm (shift ot uni).
